# Direct CSV Upload

If you want more control over the exact users to import into your Multibase workspace, use the CSV upload feature.

In this guide, we'll walk through the steps to upload a CSV file containing user data.

## Step 1: Click the "Import CSV" button

From the [addresses](https://app.multibase.co/addresses) page, click the "Import CSV" button.

    unoptimized={true}
    width={150} 
    height={100}
/>

## Step 2: Select chain

Select the chain you want to import users to.

    alt="Select chain"
    unoptimized={true}
    width={400} 
    height={300}
/>

## Step 3: Configure CSV fields

The columns you need to import your CSV are as follows:

- `address`: The address of the user you want to import
- `label`: The label you want to assign to the user (optional)

Leave the `label` column blank if you don't want to assign a label to the user.

Sample:

| address | label |
| ------- | ----- |
| 0x123... | Twitter Campaign #12  |
| 0x456... | Discord User |
| 0x789... | Twitter Follower |
| 0xabc... | Discord User |
| 0xdef... | Twitter Follower |

## Step 4: Import CSV and wait for synchronization

Click the `confirm` button and wait for the addresses to synchronize.
