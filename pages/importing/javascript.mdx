# Import users from the JavaScript SDK

Importing users with the Multibase JavaScript SDK is the best way to track user activity on your product and connect it to on-chain activity. This guide will walk you through the steps to get started with the Multibase JavaScript SDK.

In this guide, we'll walk through the process of importing users from your client to Multibase.

## Step 1: Installation

First, you'll need to install the Multibase JavaScript SDK. You can do this with npm or yarn.

```bash
# npm
npm install @multibase/js

# yarn
yarn add @multibase/js
```

## Step 2: Initialization

Then, you must initialize with your Multibase write API key. You can find your write API key in your [settings](https://app.multibase.co/settings) page.

```javascript
import { init } from '@multibase/js'

init(YOUR_WRITE_API_KEY)
```

## Step 3: Import users

To import users, you'll need to call the `identify` function. This will send the address to Multibase and automatically sync the address.

```javascript
import { identify } from "@multibase/js"

// Basic identifying call
identify({
    type: "address",
    address: "0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045",
    chain: 1
})

// Identify with properties
const userProperties = {
    plan: "Premium User",
    email: "vitalik@ethereum.org"
}
identify({
    type: "address",
    address: "0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045",
    chain: 1,
    properties: userProperties
})
```
