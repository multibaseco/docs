# What is Multibase?

Multibase is a Web3 analytics tool that lets you understand how users interact with your decentralized application, NFT collection, or Web3 community. Multibase allows you to analyze this data through simple, interactive reports that provide insightful visualizations and can be queried with just a few clicks.

Use our powerful queries to gain valuable insights into user behavior, track activity patterns, and make data-driven decisions. At Multibase, we prioritize privacy, security, and user-centric insights, ensuring that your data is protected while offering meaningful analytics to drive your business forward.

## Introduction to the Platform

Multibase is built around building reports and segmenting your user base. The platform is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, but there are a few concepts that you should understand before you get started.

### Events

Event Queries allow you to graph historical data over time, enabling you to track user activity patterns within your DApps or blockchain protocols. By analyzing events such as user interactions, transactions, and other on-chain activities, you gain a comprehensive understanding of how users engage with your platform. This information helps you identify trends, peak usage periods, and patterns that can guide your decision-making process, allowing you to optimize your application or protocol to better meet user needs.

### Distribution

Distribution Queries help you find overlap among user properties and on-chain activities, providing valuable insights into user behavior and interaction. By examining the distribution of user attributes, such as geographic location, age, or token holdings, in relation to specific on-chain activities, you can identify patterns and correlations. This enables you to tailor your marketing strategies, personalize user experiences, and target specific user segments effectively.

### Retention

Retention Queries play a vital role in time-cohorting users based on their likelihood to perform on-chain or off-chain actions. These queries help you understand user retention and engagement, allowing you to identify which user cohorts are more likely to take specific actions within a given time period. By analyzing user retention rates, you can optimize your strategies to enhance user engagement, increase loyalty, and drive business growth.

### Pathfinder

Pathfinder Queries provide a map of user navigation after executing an event or on-chain transaction. Understanding user journeys is crucial to improving user experiences and optimizing your DApps or blockchain protocols. By analyzing the paths users take, you can identify common drop-off points, bottlenecks, or areas where users might get confused or disengaged. This insight allows you to optimize user flows, enhance usability, and increase user satisfaction.

### Funnel

Funnel Queries help you determine the conversion rate between events or on-chain transactions. Funnels are a sequence of events or actions that users undertake within your platform. By setting up funnels, you can measure the effectiveness of your user acquisition and conversion strategies
